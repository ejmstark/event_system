For now, this is a non-profit project by the students of Software Engineering 2 of University of San Carlos. It is a web based application for creating, joining, and viewing events that are available anywhere in the Philippines. It serves as a good medium for people with busy schedule but want to join events that cater their interests. It is also a system that can help organizers to manage and promote their events.
